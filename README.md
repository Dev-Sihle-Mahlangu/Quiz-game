# My First Project

A simple **interactive quiz game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end web development, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic.  

It’s designed to be **beginner-friendly** and can be extended later using **React** or **Node.js** for full-stack functionality.
